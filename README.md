Visualizing diabetes data can provide valuable insights into the relationships between different variables and help in understanding patterns within the dataset.

Here are some common visualization techniques we can use with diabetes data:

Histograms and Density Plots: These are useful for understanding the distribution of continuous variables such as glucose levels, blood pressure, or BMI.

Scatter Plots: Scatter plots can help visualize the relationship between two continuous variables, such as glucose levels versus BMI or age.

Box Plots: Box plots are useful for visualizing the distribution of a continuous variable across different categories, such as blood pressure levels for diabetic and non-diabetic patients.

Bar Plots: Bar plots can be used to visualize the distribution of categorical variables, such as the distribution of diabetic and non-diabetic patients by gender.
